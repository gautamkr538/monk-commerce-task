# Monk Commerce – Coupon Management API

A production-ready and extensible **Coupon Management Engine** designed to support multiple discount models, including **Cart-Wise**, **Product-Wise**, and **BxGy (“Buy X Get Y”)** offers. The implementation addresses real-world business requirements such as global and per-user usage limits, coupon prioritization, stacking rules, excluded product handling, tiered BxGy configurations, and comprehensive validation.

Developed using modern **Java and Spring Boot** practices, the system emphasizes clean architecture, scalability, maintainability, and adherence to key engineering principles such as the **Strategy Pattern**, **Open/Closed Principle**, and a well-structured layered architecture.

**Technology Stack:**  
**Java 21 · Spring Boot 3 · PostgreSQL · Hibernate/JPA · Swagger/OpenAPI · Lombok · Jakarta Validation · Maven**

# Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**
- **Hibernate/JPA with JOINED Inheritance**
- **Lombok**
- **Swagger / OpenAPI**
- **Maven**

# Database Schema (JOINED Inheritance)

<img width="3820" height="2503" alt="schema_architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43c2dd62-2737-4912-80f1-c4ba98d543fa" />

The coupon engine uses **JOINED strategy** to map:

- `coupon` → base table  
- `cart_wise_coupon` → derived table
- `product_wise_coupon` → derived table
- `bxgy_coupon` → derived table
- `buy_product` → child of bxgy_coupon (buy items per tier)  
- `get_product` → child of bxgy_coupon (free items per tier)  
- `excluded_product` → products excluded from a coupon
- `coupon_usage` → tracks usage per user

Indexes added for performance and optimized search.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core Coupon Types
- **Cart-Wise** (threshold + discount + max cap)
- **Product-Wise** (specific product discount + max per product cap)
- **BxGy** (multi-buy, multi-get, repetition limit, tier support)

**Example – Limited Flash Sale**
- `max_usage_limit: 100`
- `usage_limit_per_user: 1`
- Output: **“45 redeemed, 55 remaining globally”**

**Example – Tiered BxGy**
- Buy 2 A → Get 1 B free  
- Buy 4 A → Get 2 B free  
- `repetition_limit: 2`  
- Output: **“Cart: 8 × A qualifies for 4 × B free”**

---

### 2. Usage Tracking & Limits
- Global usage limit (`max_usage_limit`)
- Per-user usage limit (`usage_limit_per_user`)
- Track total usage & user-specific usage
- Show remaining uses for both

**Example – Loyalty Reward Coupon**
- Unlimited global usage  
- Per-user limit: **5**  
- Output: **“User has 3 uses remaining”**

---

### 3. Priority System
- Each coupon has **priority (0–N)**
- Coupons sorted by priority (DESC)
- Highest priority coupon selected
- Combined with discount calculation for best match

**Example:**
- Coupon A → 10% off (priority: 10)
- Coupon B → 5% off (priority: 5)
- System selects **Coupon A**

---

### 4. Stacking (Metadata Level)
- `is_stackable` flag stored
- Returned in API responses
- Future-ready for multi-coupon stacking

**Example:**
- Coupon A (`is_stackable: true`)
- Coupon B (`is_stackable: true`)
- Future system can apply **both simultaneously**

---

### 5. Excluded Products
- Configurable exclusion list
- Coupon automatically rejected if excluded product is in cart

**Example:**
- Exclude: `Product X, Product Y`  
- If cart contains X → **coupon invalid**

---

### 6. Tiered BxGy (Multi-Level Buy X Get Y)
- Multiple **tier levels**
- Auto-detect best tier
- Enforce repetition limit
- Optimized free item calculation

**Example:**
- Cart: **8 × Product A**  
- Tier: Buy 4 A → Get 2 B  
- Applied twice → **4 × Product B free**

---

### 7. Discount Calculation Engine
Using **Strategy Pattern**, supports:
- Percentage-based discounts
- Max discount caps
- Per-product discount caps
- Free item discounts (BxGy)
- Threshold validation
- Product presence checks
- Multi-tier BxGy validation

**Example:**
- BxGy → validates buy & get quantity  
- Cart-wise → validates threshold + cap

---

### 8. Validation & Error Handling
Handled via validators & exception handler:
- Empty cart
- Invalid quantity/price
- Duplicate products
- Expired/inactive coupon
- Invalid coupon ID
- Threshold not met
- Product not present (product-wise)
- Insufficient buy quantity (BxGy)

**Example:**
- User applies expired coupon → Error  
- User exceeds usage limit → Error  

---

### 9. CRUD Operations
- Create coupon (auto-generates code if absent)
- Retrieve active coupons
- Get coupon by ID
- Update coupon
- Soft delete (mark `is_active=false`)

**Example:**
- Coupon deletion → never hard deleted, only soft-removed

---

### 10. Cart Operations
- Fetch applicable coupons
- Apply coupon to cart
- Compute final payable amount
- Add free items for BxGy
- Return detailed discount breakdown

**Example:**
- Applied coupon → updated cart + free items + total discount

---

# Strategy Pattern

Each coupon type has its own strategy:

```java
public interface CouponStrategy {
    boolean isApplicable(CartRequestDTO cart, Coupon coupon);
    double calculateDiscount(CartRequestDTO cart, Coupon coupon);
    UpdatedCartDTO apply(CartRequestDTO cart, Coupon coupon);
}
```

Factory resolves correct strategy:

```java
switch (couponType) {
    case CART_WISE -> cartWiseCouponStrategy;
    case PRODUCT_WISE -> productWiseCouponStrategy;
    case BXGY -> bxGyCouponStrategy;
}
```

Ensures OCP (Open-Closed Principle) → new coupon types require **zero modification** to existing logic.

# Complete Scenario Coverage Summary

### Important Future Enhancements

#### 1. Multi-Coupon Stacking Engine
Apply multiple eligible coupons at once:
- Apply in priority order
- Combine discounts carefully
- Prevent conflicts with non-stackable coupons

#### 2. Schedule-Based Coupons
- Time-of-day restrictions (happy hours)
- Day-of-week rules

#### 3. User Segmentation
- First-order coupons
- Loyalty tier coupons

#### 4. Category & Brand Based Coupons
- Requires product catalog integration

#### 5. Inventory-Dependent Coupons
- Stock-based limits

#### 6. Mapping Optimization (Dozer/MapStruct)
We can eliminate mapping boilerplate using:
- **Dozer**
- **MapStruct**
- Or a custom **DozerUtil**

This will make DTO ↔ Entity mapping maintainable & cleaner.

## 📌 Assumptions & Limitations

---

## Core Assumptions

| Assumption | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Single coupon per cart during apply phase** | Initial design keeps apply flow simple; stacking handled later in resolver logic |
| **Cart items remain in-memory during request cycle** | No user session/cart persistence implemented |
| **Coupons sorted by priority (DESC)** | Ensures highest-benefit coupon is evaluated first |
| **Excluded products blacklist entire product** | Variant-level exclusion (e.g., SKU-level) not implemented |
| **Discount cannot exceed cart total** | Hard safety cap to prevent negative payable amounts |
| **User ID is authenticated & trusted** | No additional validation to prevent cross-user coupon usage |
| **BxGy tiered logic always gives max benefit** | System automatically selects the highest qualifying tier |

---

## Functional Limitations

| Limitation | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **No multi-coupon conflict prevention** | Incorrectly marked stackable coupons may get combined in future stacking logic |
| **No sequential validation for stacking** | Complex order-based stacking scenarios not enforced |
| **Scheduled activation (`start_date`) not supported** | Coupons become active immediately if `is_active = true` |
| **No user segmentation (VIP, loyalty tiers)** | All coupons available to all users unless explicitly restricted |
| **Category-based or brand-based coupons not available** | Coupons apply only to product IDs or entire cart |

---

## Performance Limitations

- **No caching layer (Redis/Memcached)**  
  → Every coupon check hits the database directly.

- **JOINED inheritance increases join cost**  
  → Polymorphic queries are heavier than single-table mappings.

- **Soft delete (`is_active`) adds filter overhead**  
  → Every query requires filtering inactive coupons.

---

## Security Limitations

- **No rate limiting on coupon endpoints**  
  → System can be abused for brute-force coupon code guessing.

- **User identity trusted without cross-check**  
  → No validation preventing user impersonation for coupon usage.

- **No audit logs for coupon application**  
  → Fraud detection, anomaly tracking, and rollback not possible.
