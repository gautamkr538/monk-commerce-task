# Monk Commerce – Coupon Management API's

A production-ready and extensible **Coupon Management Engine** designed to support multiple discount models, including **Cart-Wise**, **Product-Wise**, and **BxGy (“Buy X Get Y”)** offers. The implementation addresses real-world business requirements such as global and per-user usage limits, coupon prioritization, stacking rules, excluded product handling, tiered BxGy configurations, and comprehensive validation.

Developed using modern **Java and Spring Boot** practices, the system emphasizes clean architecture, scalability, maintainability, and adherence to key engineering principles such as the **Strategy Pattern**, **Open/Closed Principle**, and a well-structured layered architecture.

**Technology Stack:**  
**Java 21 · Spring Boot 3 · PostgreSQL · Hibernate/JPA · Swagger/OpenAPI · Lombok · Jakarta Validation · Maven**.

# Technologies Used

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3 (REST + DI + Validation)**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Hibernate/JPA with JOINED Inheritance**
- **Lombok**
- **Swagger / OpenAPI**
- **Maven**

# Database Schema (JOINED Inheritance)

<img width="3820" height="2503" alt="schema_architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43c2dd62-2737-4912-80f1-c4ba98d543fa" />

The coupon engine uses **JOINED strategy** to map:

- `coupon` → base table  
- `cart_wise_coupon` → derived table
- `product_wise_coupon` → derived table
- `bxgy_coupon` → derived table
- `buy_product` → child of bxgy_coupon (buy items per tier)  
- `get_product` → child of bxgy_coupon (free items per tier)  
- `excluded_product` → products excluded from a coupon
- `coupon_usage` → tracks usage per user

Indexes added for performance and optimized search.

# Features Implemented

## 1. Core Coupon Types
- **Cart-Wise** (threshold + discount + max cap)
- **Product-Wise** (specific product discount + max per product cap)
- **BxGy** (multi-buy, multi-get, repetition limit, tier support)

---

## 2. Usage Tracking & Limits
Fully implemented:

- Global usage limit (`max_usage_limit`)
- Per-user usage limit (`usage_limit_per_user`)
- Track total usage & user-specific usage
- Show remaining uses for both

---

## 3. Priority System
- Each coupon has a **priority (0–N)**
- Applicable coupons sorted by priority **DESC**
- Higher priority coupons shown first
- Combined with discount calculation to identify the **best coupon**

---

## 4. Stacking (Metadata Level)
- `is_stackable` boolean flag implemented
- Returned in API responses
- Controls future stacking rules  
  (*Full multi-coupon stacking will come in future phase*)

---

## 5. Excluded Products
- Configurable excluded product list
- Coupon is rejected if excluded product appears in cart
- Ensures realistic exclusion logic (premium items, special SKUs)

---

## 6. Tiered BxGy (Multi-Level Buy X Get Y)
- Supports **tier_level 1, 2, 3...**
- Auto-detect best applicable tier
- Repetition limit enforced
- Free item calculation optimized
- Discount calculation based on tier rules

---

## 7. Discount Calculation Engine
Built with Strategy Pattern:

- Percentage discounts
- Max-discount caps
- Per-product discount cap
- Free item discount logic (BxGy)
- Cart threshold validations
- Product presence validations
- BxGy buy quantity & get quantity validations

---

## 8. Validation & Error Handling
Handled through validators + exception handler:

- Empty cart
- Negative values
- Duplicate products
- Expired coupon
- Inactive coupon
- Invalid ID
- Below threshold
- Missing product for product-wise
- Insufficient buy quantity for BxGy

All mapped to uniform error response DTO.

---

## 9. CRUD Operations
- Create Coupon (auto-generate coupon code if not provided)
- Get all active coupons
- Get coupon by ID
- Update coupon
- Soft delete coupon via `is_active` flag

---

## 10. Cart Operations
- Fetch applicable coupons
- Apply a coupon to cart
- Compute final payable amount
- Insert free items for BxGy
- Final response contains per-item + total discount

---

# Strategy Pattern

Each coupon type has its own strategy:

```java
public interface CouponStrategy {
    boolean isApplicable(CartRequestDTO cart, Coupon coupon);
    double calculateDiscount(CartRequestDTO cart, Coupon coupon);
    UpdatedCartDTO apply(CartRequestDTO cart, Coupon coupon);
}
```

Factory resolves correct strategy:

```java
switch (couponType) {
    case CART_WISE -> cartWiseCouponStrategy;
    case PRODUCT_WISE -> productWiseCouponStrategy;
    case BXGY -> bxGyCouponStrategy;
}
```

Ensures OCP (Open-Closed Principle) → new coupon types require **zero modification** to existing logic.

### <u>Important Future Enhancements</u>

#### 1. Multi-Coupon Stacking Engine
Apply multiple eligible coupons at once:
- Apply in priority order
- Combine discounts carefully
- Prevent conflicts with non-stackable coupons

#### 2. Schedule-Based Coupons
- Time-of-day restrictions (happy hours)
- Day-of-week rules

#### 3. User Segmentation
- First-order coupons
- Loyalty tier coupons

#### 4. Category & Brand Based Coupons
- Requires product catalog integration

#### 5. Inventory-Dependent Coupons
- Stock-based limits

#### 6. Mapping Optimization (Dozer/MapStruct)
We can eliminate mapping boilerplate using:

- **Dozer**
- **MapStruct**
- Or a custom **DozerUtil**

This will make DTO ↔ Entity mapping maintainable & cleaner.
